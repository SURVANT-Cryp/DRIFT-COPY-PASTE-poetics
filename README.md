Similar to the Dadaists, William S. Burroughs, and John Cage, I am interested in how aleatory operations—like the cut-up technique—can spur the development of new ideas about mediated culture and communication.

“As interpreted by Gregory Ulmer (in his book, <em>Applied Grammatology</em>), Jacques Derrida’s philosophical project was not merely to deconstruct language, but to initiate a new way of writing. This new way of writing involves slippage—one homonym into another. Derrida’s new ‘grammatological’ way of writing is less concerned with historical/etymological connections between words and more concerned with future/generative connections between words. Derrida is not concerned (merely) with what language has meant, but what language may come to mean. Derrida’s project is not about arbitrary, willy-nilly slippage; but it instead involves a very rigorous kind of play and failure. At one point, Ulmer (charmingly) calls Derrida, ‘so rigorously irresponsible.’ This kind of grammatological remixing of language has no end. It never settles on a fixed state where language ceases to evolve and each word finally comes to mean one and only one thing. Instead, meaning is always emerging and subsiding, and stasis is perpetually deferred and postponed. Ulmer’s Derrida proposes a writing not of increasingly precise taxonomies and increasingly accurate canonical texts, but a writing of perpetually emergent creation and invention—a remix writing.”<br>

Irish art critic Declan Long states that his research “seeks to consider how attention to marginal, neglected, or ‘failed’ sites within and on the margins of cities might create productive political spaces of  uncertainty that prompt speculation on alternatives to the certainties of our present ‘reality.’”<br>

“A cluster of glitches can form an outline, define an area, trace a route through uncharted space. This space is an n-dimensional 'potential space' and glitches can be used to navigate this space, seeking unexpected patterns, chance juxtapositions, and unveiling subliminal content.”<br>

“It is not futile to do what we do. We wake up with energy and we do something. And we make, of course, failures and we make mistakes, but we sometimes get glimpses of what we might do next.”<br>

The origins of computer hacking can be traced back to the late 1950s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology where a group of students—many of which were a part of the Tech Model Railway Club (TMRC)—began experimenting with various computing machines on campus. At this time, most computers took up entire rooms and required a group of engineers and machine operators to maintain them. The hulking IBM 704 was particularly difficult to maintain. As Steven Levy explains in his book, <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, student access to this computer was extremely limited:<br>

<em>All these people in charge of punching cards, feeding them into readers, and pressing buttons and switches on the machine were what was commonly called a Priesthood, and those privileged enough to submit data to those most holy priests were the official acolytes. It was an almost ritualistic exchange.

ACOLYTE: Oh machine, would you accept my offer of information so you may run my program and perhaps give me a computation?

PRIEST (on behalf of the machine): We will try. We promise nothing.</em> (Levy, 5)

An interesting custom in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn is the placing of books on front stoops and ledges for other community members to take and use. These books are not for sale or for the garbage or recycling truck; they are just there for the taking. This grassroots book sharing practice is rooted in the belief that community resources should be shared and utilized rather than wasted. The view that sharing is a moral good is central to the hacker ethic as well. Although hacker philosophy originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s-60s, the <em>hacker ethic</em> was not formally laid out until the release of <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em> in 1984. Levy believes hackers are primarily concerned with access. To the hacker, the free exchange of information is crucial to innovation. Their belief that access to knowledge should be free, decentralized, anti-bureaucratic, and anti-authoritarian stems in part from the lack of access the TMRC hackers had to the machines on campus. The TMRC hackers redefined the computer by creating groundbreaking programs (and eventually whole operating systems), but only after they challenged the bureaucratic institution tasked with regulating access to the machines at MIT. Because of their influential hacking experiments computers were no longer viewed as number-crunching war machines, but rather, expressive tools with seemingly limitless creative potential.<br>

The Hacker Ethic<br>
1. Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On imperative!<br>
2. All information should be free.<br>
3. Mistrust authority - promote decentralization.<br>
4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.<br>
5. You can create art and beauty on a computer.<br>
6. Computers can change your life for the better. (Levy, 26-36)<br>
