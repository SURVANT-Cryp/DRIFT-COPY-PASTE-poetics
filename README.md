<b>DRIFT/COPY/PASTE poetics 1</b>

a.	Randomly select text fragments from social media feeds<br>
b.	Hack on gathered words and phrases<br>
c.	Construct tercets out of the textual rubble<br>

Similar to the Dadaists, William S. Burroughs, and John Cage, I am interested in how aleatory operations—like the cut-up technique—can spur the development of new ideas about mediated culture and communication.

a text-based dérive.<br>
a critique of the hegemony of meaning.<br>
an oracle.<br>
